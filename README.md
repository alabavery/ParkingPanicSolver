# ParkingPanicSolver
Python 3 implementation of algorithm to solve 'Parking Panic' puzzles

Parking Panic is a game on the website [coolmath-games](http://www.coolmath-games.com/) that millenials played in 
early adolescence, before more stimulating internet games came along.  Each level of the game tasks the player with 
shifting vehicles in a parking lot until one particular vehicle can exit the lot.  It is like a more complex 
version of [the slide puzzle game](http://www.tobar.co.uk/slide-number-puzzle).  The easiest way to understand how 
the game works is [to just play the first level](http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-parking-panic) (you may want to 
turn the sound on your computer off).

Make no mistake, although it is ostensibly a children's game, as you get into the higher levels, things can get 
tough.  But have no fear - you can use Parking Panic Solver to solve these levels for you!

Parking Panic Solver is a [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0.1/) implementation of an 
algorithm that takes as input the starting state for a level of Parking Panic and outputs a description of all the 
moves needed to complete the level.  These moves are then depicted graphically through [PyPlot](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html). Browse the Wiki to learn more about he implementation.

Here is a demo of ParkingPanicSolver at work.  The yellow bar represents the parking lot exit, each rectangle represents a vehicle, and the red vehicle represents the vehicle that the player must get out of the parking lot.
